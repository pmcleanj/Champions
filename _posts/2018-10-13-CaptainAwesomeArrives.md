For quite some time our heroes have known about a symposium sponsored by the Provincial 
Government on “Law Enforcement in the Age Of Superpowers”, scheduled for the Tuesday after 
Labour Day in Red Deer. The keynote speaker is none other than Captain Awesome, the famous 
American superhero, who has considerable experience in battling super-villians on the US 
eastern seaboard. His battles with his arch nemesis Captain Napalm are legendary. <!--more-->
He also has been granted International Police Powers by Interpol, and has participated in 
operations in Europe and Japan.

When this was announced, the Alberta government received a note from Ironclad of the D.C. 
based superhero group “The Champions” warning that wherever Captain Awesome goes, Captain 
Napalm is never far behind, trying to disrupt everything Awesome accomplishes. A brief 
rundown on Napalm’s powers was attached — flight at Mach speeds, automatic and single-shot 
energy blasts, and incendiary attacks, including a “sticky” one that sticks to and 
continues to burn its victims (his signature attack).

Stick has been invited to attend on behalf of the Posse. His plan is to drive up the Tuesday morning, spend the night in a hotel, and return after it ends on the Wednesday.

In the first panel, we see the Coutts/Sweetgrass border crossing, between Montana and Alberta. There are several big rigs lined up for customs inspection, and a few cars.

In the next few panels, we see a spec in the sky, watch it grow into a human figure, then see Captain Awesome touch down and walk past US Customs, over the border, and up to Canadian Customs. As he moves through the facility people point and look, call out to him, and take selfies. He smiles and waves back, taking whatever time is needed to make his adoring fans happy. His megawatt smile lights the place up.

He finally reaches Canadian Customs, and the CBSA agents are every bit as star-struck as everyone else. They ask for his passport, and he hands over a red-jacketed US passport in the name of “Captain Awesome”.

“What is the purpose of your visit?”

“I am speaking at a symposium on Law Enforcement In The Age of Superpowers. I have a work permit attached to my passport.”

The border agent flips through the passport and verifies the work visa. “How long will you be in Canada?”

“Five days. The symposium is Tuesday and Wednesday, and I will be returning to the US on Thursday.”

“Where will you be staying while in Canada?”

“The Marriott Sheraton Hotel And Convention Centre, in Red Deer” he says, clearly managing to enunciate the Canadian “re” in “Centre” (vs. the American “er”).

“Everything seems to be in order. Have a nice stay.”

Captain Awesome walks through the customs building and out on the Canadian side. He waves at onlookers and poses for a few more selfies before flying away to the north.
