title: Griswold discovers Agatha
---
Griswold and his team are meeting in their hotel room. “We’ve got a few days data from the 
GPS trackers on the Wheeler family vehicles, and I’ve found a very interesting anomaly”, 
says one of the men. <!--more-->He brings up a map of the city on his laptop. Several 
locations are flagged. "Many of their destinations we can rule out as their business 
location, and stores or other commercial locations they do business at. Others are 
residential addresses with family members likely to be associating with the Wheelers. But 
THIS address is very different — it is a residential property owned by a trust fund 
administered by a Vancouver law firm. Everything about the property is locked down." The 
laptop does a zoom-in on one of the icons, going to Street View. We recognize the safe 
house where the Brat Pack has been staying. “Only Agatha Wheeler has been travelling 
there, and she has been spending a lot of time there, often all day and all night.

“I want cameras on that property now”, Griswold says. “Agatha does not profile as the type 
to have a ‘secret family’, or even an extra-marital lover”, one of the men comments. 
“Could this be the Posse’s base of operations?” Griswold responds “It is unlikely that 
Agatha Wheeler would be involved in that to this level”, but SOMETHING odd is going on 
there. The cameras will tell us”. Another one of the men says “I’ll put up the cameras, 
and do a preliminary scout of the property. Should I go inside?” “No,” Griswold says, 
“external only. But tap the phones too, so we can monitor their microphones externally and 
get audio from inside.” The man nods and leaves, grabbing a ‘Telus’ coverall on his way 
out the door.
