FADE-IN
Long shot, exterior, business hotel & conference centre in Long Beach, CA
Sign reads "Hollywood Memorabilia Auction Today"<!--more-->

CUT TO
Interior, conference hall.
There are a number of tables containing various action lots, all labelled. A small crowd mills around them.

ZOOM IN
Display case, signage reads: Lot 219, Star Trek Phaser, Tricorder and Communicator used by Walter Koenig in the Season 3 episode "The Spectre of the Gun".

CUT TO
A man, wearing a TOS Science Blue uniform, Vulcan ears and a "Spock" haircut approaches the case. After a quick, furtive glance around, he breaks the glass of the display case and removes the Phaser, Tricorder and Communicator.

AUDIO: alarm ringing

CUT TO
A security guard reacts, approaching the man and drawing his Taser. "Stay where you are, and show me your hands."

SPOCK "You can see my hands adequately as they are," he says, as he points the prop Phaser at the guard.

GUARD "Seriously ..."

SPOCK fires the Phaser. A blue-white beam strikes the guard. There is a cheesy 60's optical effect style flash, and the guard drops to the floor, stunned. Spock flips the communicator open. "Spock to Enterprise, one to beam up." He disappears in the sparkle of the transporter effect, as startled onlookers gape.

FADE TO BLACK

A star field appears.

SHATNER "Space, the final frontier. These are the voyages of the starship 'Enterprise', its five year mission: to explore strange new worlds; to seek out new life, and new civilizations; to boldly go where no man has gone before."
