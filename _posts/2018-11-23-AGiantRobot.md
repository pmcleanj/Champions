8. Gallowglas scowls at the electric field on the robot. She turns her attention to the 
camera drone that has been following her. She runs up to a point just under it, and throws 
her dagger at it. It falls from the sky and lies at her feet, its servos twitching 
ineffectively. She symbolically stomps on it.

Tom-tom, seeing Electron unconscious at his feet, turns his attentions to the next closest target: The Librarian. He runs over to her, winds up and lets fly a massive punch, using all the STR he can muster, while shouting Tom-tom SMASH puny monkey! It looks like The Librarian is about to respond, correcting his usage of “monkey”, but Tom-tom’s fist connects and cuts her off. The Librarian grunts and gets up, saying “Monkey?!?! I’m no monkey you ignorant fool! Do you SEE a tail? NO! I’m an orangutang you blithering idiot, and you need more than THAT to take me down!” She winds up and delivers the biggest punch SHE can muster, catching Tom-tom on the point of his chin. He arcs backwards, into the wall of the Harry Hayes building, and slides into a crumpled, unmoving heap at its base.

C4, seeing Tom-tom indisposed, and more than a little bit too close for comfort, and applies Ground Zero to him, again.

Psyclist uses his mental blast on Umbra. Stick, still feeling weak after being K.O.ed by Quickdraw, attempts to recover. Alphonse uses her TK shove on Umbra, slamming him back into the wall of the Harry Hayes building, where he, too, falls unconscious to the sidewalk.

Redcoat gets up from the street where he’d fallen, and looks around. All targets in the immediate vicinity are down. He looks at the robot, and thinks “This can wait.” He notices the crowd around the fallen Nancy Renfrew. “Is that …” he thinks, then “… it IS, it’s Nancy Renfrew. Well, I have my duty.” He runs over towards her, but as he approaches, Mistral creates a 16m wide wind zone across his path — with the force of a small tornado. Redcoat calls out to him. “She is a fugitive from justice. There is a warrant out for her arrest. Don’t make this any harder than it has to be.”

Thunder says to Lightning “Honeybunch, be a dearie and take Nancy back to the safe house. We’ll hold them off.” She blows him a kiss, then flies around the end of the wind zone, towards Redcoat. Redcoat says “This is obstruction of justice. Don’t add assaulting a police officer to the list.” Thunder says “Bring it, oppressor!”, complete with hand gesture. Lightning takes a half-move to run over to Nancy, touches her, and the two teleport 20m down the block. Can Opener, seeing Thunder moving threateningly against Redcoat, opens fire on her, hitting her.

Slammer moves up to Umbra, and belts him one more time.

Ghost moves over to where Quickdraw fell, and clobbers her again.

9. With a thunderous roar, the robot takes to the air, flying over the still-burning incendiary attack and wind zone, and following Lightning and Renfrew down the avenue. It can’t quite reach them, stopping a few metres short.

10. Gallowglas begins running towards Redcoat and Thunder. The Librarian runs over to Electron. “Are you OK” she asks him. He stirs, and groggily answers “Did anyone get the license plate number of that truck?”.

C4 targets Tom-tom one more time. Stick charges Tom-tom, and hits him hard. Psyclist holds his action, unsure who is a good guy, and who is not. Alphonse also holds her action.

Redcoat fires a plasma blast at Thunder, hitting her. “Is that all you’ve got, dearie?” she responds, then runs up and punches him. Redcoat falls unconscious to the ground. Can Opener then shoots Thunder, again, and she, too, falls unconscious.

Lightning teleports again, taking Nancy Renfew with him, across the street, into the lobby of the hotel.

Slammer walks over from Umbra to Bullman, and picks up his whip. “You are NOTHING without this!”, he chortles gleefully.

Ghost, seeing Thunder taking fire from the nearby rooftop in defence of the Rt. Honourable Nancy Renfew, member for Kicking Horse Pass and former Minister on the Status of Women, goes desolid and flies invisibly up and over towards the dark black cloud on the rooftop where the attack originated.

12. The Librarian runs towards the remains of the fight. Gallowglas runs up to Redcoat and applies the Wheel Feat, slamming him to the ground, and knocking him out. The Librarian looks aghast.

The fires from the incendiary attack finally burn out.

C4 and Stick both run towards the fight, Electron flies.

Mistral drops the wind zone, which quickly dissipates. He fires his wind blast at the robot, but doesn’t appear to damage it.

Can Opener shoots at Gallowglas, and misses.

Lightning teleports himself and Nancy Renfrew deeper into the hotel, out of sight from the street.

Slammer whacks Bullman, again, just to be sure.

Ghost flies up behind the black bubble surrounding Can Opener, invisible and desolid, and lands.

The robot flies across the street to the hotel, falls prone and lunges his arm into the hotel lobby, crashing through the window sending furniture and patrons flying, but it is too late to grab Lighting or Nancy Renfrew.

End of 12 recovery, for those who get one.

High up on the side of a tall building overlooking the fight, unseen from the street, a lone figure clings to the concrete with cat-like claws. “Damn that jammer,” reads his thought bubble, “I almost had it!”
