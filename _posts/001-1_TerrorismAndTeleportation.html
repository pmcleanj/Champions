	<h4>Background</h4>
	<p>Calgarians are shocked as the various news media report coordinated terror bombings
	   from around the world:</p>
	   <ul>
	   <li>The earilest attack is on the French Riviera attack and is quickly 
	   attributed to jihadists;</li>
	   <li>In Canada, car bombs are exploded at crowded border crossings, coinciding with 
	   the Labour day weekend and crowded holiday traffic. The borders are “temporarily” 
	   closed; and the War Measures Act is declared, incidentally suspending the upcoming 
	   October electoral process and leaving Stephen Harper in power. RCMP take over 
	   control of major city policing. In Calgary, the Mayor is placed under house arrest.</li>
	   <li>In Britain, an attack on Kensington palace kills the Duke & Duchess of Cambridge
	   and critically injures Prince George; princess Charlotte vanishes. New travel 
	   restrictions are opposed. The Scottish parliament is suspended. </li>
	   <li>Very large explosions, accompanied by rumours of mushroom clouds and radiation, 
	   are reported in New York City, Toronto, Paris, London, Sidney, Bombay, Tel Aviv, &
	   Tokyo. Terrorists associated with Daesh claim responsibility calling this 
	   "Vengeance on the Capitals of Decadence". Smaller explosions are rumoured to have 
	   involved gas dispersal and unidentified white powder speculated to be Anthrax.</li>
	   <li>Reaction in the west includes international warrants issued for a number of 
	   high-profile Islamisists, bombings of mosques by KKK followed by warrants issued 
	   for KKK members fleeing the U.S. and rumours that the Canadian government members
	   are implicated in offering asylum to reactionary militants. </li>
	   <li> In Japan, restorationists are leading riots in Japan: take control of Kyoto. 
	   Borders closed to Japanese fleeing radiation from Tokyo bombing and civil war. 
	   Refugees dying in hospital. 
	   <li>Montana survivalists close border, blowing up border control stations.</li>
	   </ul>
	   
	<h4>Engaging Our Heros</h4>
	<p>Basically, there is enough disruption going on all around the world, to disrupt the 
	   daily lives of all of our heroes and bring them into proximity with one another for 
	   our adventure to kick off</p>
	    <ul>
	   <li><strong>Bernadette</strong> is on a cross-Canada tour. She should have left Calgary  
	   today for Vancouver, Rumour that Vancouver is on “The List” (leaked to press). </li>
	   <li><strong>Xiang</strong>Movie shut down indefinately, director and producer 
	   arrested.</li>
	   <li><strong>Jazz</strong>Curfew imposed. All our homeless types end up in the tank.</li>
	   <li><strong>Paul</strong></li>
	   <li><strong>Tia</strong> works at restaurant is across the street. </li>
	   <li><strong>Mike</strong></li>
	   <li><strong>Harris</strong></li>
	   <li><strong>Sarah</strong></li>
	   </ul>
