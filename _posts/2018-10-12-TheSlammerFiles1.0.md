Interior, Mike’s office.
Close shot, Mike’s desk.
A deck of cards is dealt out for Solitaire. <!--more-->

PAN LEFT across the desk

As the camera starts to pan, we hear a telephone start ringing.
The camera pans over the cards, an old beat-up computer, and a stack of bills before reaching a desk telephone and answering machine.

CENTER ON PHONE

A loud click is heard, as the answering machine picks up the call. We hear Mike’s voice. “You have reached Mike Slammer. Please leave your name and number at the beep, I’ll get back to you.”

A perky woman’s voice is heard. “This is Tanya, calling from Telus Business Solutions,” she says cheerfully, “we show your account to be more than 90 days in arrears. If you have not paid the full amount by the 12th, your service will be disconnected. Have a great day!”.

Della’s voice, sounding gravelly, says “I’m sick Mike, and won’t be in today”. In the background you can hear another voice saying “Hurry up, or we’ll miss our tee time!”. There is some rustling, as the receiver is covered, then Della’s voice, heavily muffled, says “I’m on the PHONE!”. Then the gravelly voice returns and says “I should be in tomorrow, bye”.

A man’s voice is heard, with an Italian accent. “This is Marco Esposito calling. A friend recommended you. Some low-lifes broke into my place and stole my Ferrari. Turns out my alarm wasn’t worth shit, and I need somebody competent to put in something better. Call my estate manager at 555-1234 to set things up, I’m out of town.”
