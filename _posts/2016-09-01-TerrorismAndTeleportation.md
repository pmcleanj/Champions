Calgarians are shocked as the various news media report coordinated terror bombings
from around the world:
<!--more-->


- The earilest attack is on the French Riviera attack and is quickly 
attributed to jihadists;

- In Canada, car bombs are exploded at crowded border crossings, coinciding with 
the Labour day weekend and crowded holiday traffic. The borders are “temporarily” 
closed; and the War Measures Act is declared, incidentally suspending the upcoming 
October electoral process and leaving Prime Minister Steven Harbour in power. RCMP take over 
control of major city policing. In Calgary, the Mayor is placed under house arrest.

- In Britain, an attack on Kensington palace kills the Duke & Duchess of Cambridge
and critically injures Prince George; princess Charlotte vanishes. New travel 
restrictions are imposed. The Scottish parliament is suspended. 

- Very large explosions, accompanied by rumours of mushroom clouds and radiation, 
are reported in New York City, Toronto, Paris, London, Sidney, Bombay, Tel Aviv, &
Tokyo. Terrorists associated with Daesh claim responsibility calling this 
"Vengeance on the Capitals of Decadence". Smaller explosions are rumoured to have 
involved gas dispersal and unidentified white powder speculated to be Anthrax.

- Reaction in the west includes international warrants issued for a number of 
high-profile Islamisists, bombings of mosques by KKK followed by warrants issued 
for KKK members fleeing the U.S. and rumours that the Canadian government members
are implicated in offering asylum to reactionary militants. 

-  In Japan, restorationists are leading riots in Japan: take control of Kyoto. 
Borders closed to Japanese fleeing radiation from Tokyo bombing and civil war. 
Refugees dying in hospital. 
- Montana survivalists close border, blowing up border control stations.
