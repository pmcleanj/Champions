We’re back in the parliamentary conference room. Present are Harbour, Kenty and MacKay, who 
are talking with Redcoat, Electron, Canopener and The Librarian. <!--more-->The four are 
standing awkwardly rigid, almost at attention. Harbour asks them “You understand the 
mission?”. Their speech bubble shows them replying in unison, as if reciting a list 
memorized by rote: “1) Locate Miyati, 2) Recover the document, 3) Return both to Ottawa, 
4) Do not look at the document”. Kenty says “That’s good, I think we’ve got it”. Harper 
says “I agree”. The four lose the awkward stiffness. Harper says “Thank you for taking 
this on on such short notice, but it is a matter of the utmost urgency. National Security 
is a stake!” Redcoat salutes. “We won’t let you down”. His voice is free of the rote-like 
manner heard earlier. The four file out.

MacKay says I’m still worried. Too much can go wrong. Harbour says, I’ve got that covered. 
I told SENTINEL to move their test to Calgary, and added some special instructions, just 
in case. Kenty smirks, and says “Too bad SENTINEL is non-lethal, but polls tell us the 
public won’t accept killer drones.” Harbour says “If it comes to it, we can retask DEADEYE 
or the C.O.G.s to bat cleanup, but I think we’ve got enough contingency planning on this.”
